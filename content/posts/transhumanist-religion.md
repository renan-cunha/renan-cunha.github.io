From [Nick Bostrom's "The Transhumanist FAQ"](https://nickbostrom.com/views/transhumanist.pdf)

> While not a religion, transhumanism might serve a few of the same functions that people 
have traditionally sought in religion. It offers a sense of direction and purpose and 
suggests a vision that humans can achieve something greater than our present condition. 
Unlike most religious believers, however, transhumanists seek to make their dreams 
come true in this world, by relying not on supernatural powers or divine intervention but 
on rational thinking and empiricism, through continued scientific, technological, 
economic, and human development. Some of the prospects that used to be the exclusive 
thunder of the religious institutions, such as very long lifespan, unfading bliss, and 
godlike intelligence, are being discussed by transhumanists as hypothetical future 
engineering achievements.
