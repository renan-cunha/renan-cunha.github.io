I tried to brainstorm the [perfect Tuesday for myself](https://www.spencergreenberg.com/2011/08/planning-your-life-based-on-your-ideal-ordinary-week/), assuming I had no constraints. Here's what I came up with:

- [ ]  Wake up naturally after a good night's sleep
- [ ]  Take in morning sunlight while riding my bike (minimum of 6km)
- [ ]  Have a healthy breakfast
- [ ]  Engage in some "reflection" over a cup of coffee
    - [ ]  Think of three things I am grateful for
    - [ ]  Review my goals
    - [ ]  Review my habits
    - [ ]  Review my principles
    - [ ]  [Review Anki flashcards](https://gwern.net/spaced-repetition)
- [ ]  Have a study/work session
- [ ]  Do a weightlifting workout session with stretching at the end
- [ ]  Have a healthy lunch
- [ ]  Have another study/work session
- [ ]  Have a healthy snack
- [ ]  Enjoy some free time
- [ ]  Have a healthy dinner
- [ ]  Enjoy more free time
- [ ]  Practice sleep hygiene

What surprised me is how achievable this is, even with some constraints. This means that with simple steps, I can have the perfect or almost perfect Tuesday. On the other hand, [life is not made up of just mundane Tuesdays](https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/).
