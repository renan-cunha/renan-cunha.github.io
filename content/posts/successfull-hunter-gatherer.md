I recently watched the documentary "Hadza: Last of the First" which explores one of the few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. After watching it, I wondered what makes someone "successful" in that environment. Humanity has spent most of its existence like that, so maybe we can draw valuable insights from this.

A successful male in this environment is a combination of being a good:

- **Hunter** (provides for the community)
- **Mentor** (passes skills to younger generations)
- **Mate** (forms a long-term bond, raises a family)
- **Leader** (involves in community politics)

To replicate that in modern society, you can:

- Excel in a career and provide to your community[^1].
- Mentor the younger generation.
- Raise a family.
- Be a leader in your community.

This is likely good advice for having a meaningful life.
