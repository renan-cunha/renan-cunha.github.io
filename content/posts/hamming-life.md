Richard Hamming was famous for asking, "Which are the most important problems in your field? Why are you not working on them?" Inspired by him, I tried to think about the most important problems in life. Here is my attempt:

- Which career should you pursue? How hard should you work?
- Where should you live?
- Which friends should you surround yourself with?
- With whom should you share your life?
- How many kids, if any, should you have?
- What kind of relationship should you have with your family?
- Which activities bring you the most joy and fulfillment?
- Should you contribute to your community? Which community? And how should you contribute?
- What are your values and principles?
- Which habits should you create or break to have a better life?
- How should you maintain your physical and mental health?

And now the second question, why are you not working on these problems?
