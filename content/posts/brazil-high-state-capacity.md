Three examples of high state capacity in Brazil:

### 1. The COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout: Speed and Scale

When faced with the monumental task of vaccinating its population against COVID-19, Brazil's healthcare system rose to the challenge with impressive efficiency. Despite initial political hurdles to getting the vaccine, the rollout proceeded incredibly once it began.

Key factors in this success included:

- Leveraging existing infrastructure: Brazil's Universal Health System (SUS) provided a robust framework for vaccine distribution.
- Experience with mass vaccination: Annual flu shot campaigns honed the nation's logistical capabilities.
- Cultural acceptance: High public trust in vaccines minimized hesitancy.

The result? By late 2021, Brazil had surpassed many wealthy nations in vaccination rates, demonstrating that even a country of continental proportions can execute complex public health initiatives effectively with the right systems and cultural factors in place.

### 2. PIX: Revolutionizing Financial Inclusion

In November 2020, Brazil's Central Bank launched PIX, an instant payment system that has since transformed the country's financial landscape. PIX allows instantaneous, 24/7 transfers between individuals and businesses, free of charge for personal use.

The impact has been profound:

- Financial inclusion: Millions previously reliant on cash now participate in the digital economy.
- Economic efficiency: Reduced transaction costs and increased velocity of money.
- Innovation catalyst: Fintech startups have flourished, building on the PIX infrastructure.

PIX's success lies in its universal adoption (mandated for all major financial institutions) and user-friendly design (you can transfer money just like you send a phone message). It demonstrates how good regulation and technology can work well, even (or especially) in development countries.

### 3. The Real Plan: Taming Hyperinflation

While not recent, the Real Plan of 1994 remains one of Brazil's most significant economic achievements. It ended decades of hyperinflation, stabilizing the economy and laying the groundwork for future growth.

The plan's innovative approach included:

- Introduction of a new currency (the Real) pegged to the US dollar
- Strict monetary policies to control the money supply
- Fiscal reforms to address budget deficits

The Real Plan's success in bringing inflation from thousands of percent annually to single digits transformed Brazil's economic landscape, enabling long-term planning and investment that was previously impossible.

These successes show what's possible when Brazil's state apparatus operates at its best. Imagine if this level of effectiveness could be consistently applied across all areas of the country's governance.
