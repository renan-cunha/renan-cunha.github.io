Imagine you want to reach a goal, such as being able to do 40 push-ups when you currently can only do 5.

I believe there are mainly three things you need to reach your goal: natural capacity (absence of serious physical limitations, etc.), knowledge, and discipline. You cannot change the first factor, so let's focus on the latter two.

Knowledge helps you figure out **what** you need to do. Imagine GPT-100 exists and is omniscient. You could ask it how to reach your goal as quickly as possible, and it might suggest the following (assuming for a moment, that this is indeed the fastest way to achieve your goal):

> **1. Workout Plan**
>
> - work out 3x a week, performing 5 sets of push-ups doing as many reps as possible
>
> **2. Diet and Nutrition**
>
> - consume more calories than you expend
> - Aim for at least 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily
>
> **3. Sleep and Recovery**
>
> - Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night
>
> **4. Supplements**
>
> - Take 3-5 grams of creatine daily
>
> **5. Additional Tips**
>
> - Regularly check that your push-up form is correct

Discipline then **ensures that you do** what you need to reach your goal

- don’t skip workouts
- ensure you consume enough calories.
- make sure you get adequate sleep every night.
- don’t forget to take your supplements

Concluding

If you don’t know what to do, you lack knowledge.

If you aren't doing what you know you should be, you lack discipline.
