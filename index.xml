      <description>In this post, I will explain and implement Epsilon-Greedy, a simple algorithm that solves the contextual bandits problem. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm performs considerably well [1].
Prerequisites  A Very Short Intro to Contextual Bandits Python Numpy (Optional) Standard Multi-Armed Bandit Epsilon-Greedy Algorithm [2] Logistic Regression (You need to know what it is, not necessarily how it works)  * Note: In this article, I use the words arm and action, and the words step and round, interchangeably.</description>

      <title>Brainstorming Benchmarks for Contextual Bandits</title>

      <description>Since contextual bandits are relatively new, they haven&amp;rsquo;t been studied and tested so heavily as standard multi-armed bandits algorithms [1]. This being the case, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to design benchmarks for contextual bandits so these algorithms can be reliably tested, compared and improved.
Prerequisites  A Very Short Intro to Contextual Bandits  Simplest benchmark Many people in the AI community recommend the use of toy problems, these low complexity examples provide better and faster debugging cycles, a good property of early-stage research and experimentation.</description>

      <description>In the contextual bandits problem, we have an environment with K possible actions. The environment returns some context x, taken from a distribution X. The environment also has a function f(x, k), that calculates the reward based on the context and the chosen action k.
The goal then is to find the policy $\pi$ that maximizes the rewards obtained in the long-term. A policy is a function that maps contexts to actions.</description>

      <description>Hi, I am Renan Cunha, a Computer Scientist from Par√°, a state in northern Brazil. I made this blog to learn and write more, two things I really enjoy doing. Most of the stuff I write here is work-related, but sometimes I can end up on weird and unexpected topics.
My main interests that intersect with my work (and between themselves) are AI and Data Science. My interest in AI started because I became fascinated by the intelligent behavior that was starting to be performed by machines, and that motivated me to build software that had this kind of complexity.</description>
