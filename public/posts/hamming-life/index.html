    <h1>Hamming Questions of Your Life</h1>

    

    <p>Richard Hamming was famous for asking, &ldquo;Which are the most important problems in your field? Why are you not working on them?&rdquo; Inspired by him, I tried to think about the most important problems in life. Here is my attempt:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which career should you pursue? How hard should you work?</li>
<li>Where should you live?</li>
<li>Which friends should you surround yourself with?</li>
<li>With whom should you share your life?</li>
<li>How many kids, if any, should you have?</li>
<li>What kind of relationship should you have with your family?</li>
<li>Which activities bring you the most joy and fulfillment?</li>
<li>Should you contribute to your community? Which community? And how should you contribute?</li>
<li>What are your values and principles?</li>
<li>Which habits should you create or break to have a better life?</li>
<li>How should you maintain your physical and mental health?</li>
</ul>
<p>And now the second question, why are you not working on these problems?</p>
