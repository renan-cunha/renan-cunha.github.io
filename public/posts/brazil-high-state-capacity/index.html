    <h1>Examples of High State Capacity in Brazil</h1>

    

    <p>Three examples of high state capacity in Brazil:</p>
<h3 id="1-the-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-speed-and-scale">1. The COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout: Speed and Scale</h3>
<p>When faced with the monumental task of vaccinating its population against COVID-19, Brazil&rsquo;s healthcare system rose to the challenge with impressive efficiency. Despite initial political hurdles to getting the vaccine, the rollout proceeded incredibly once it began.</p>
<p>Key factors in this success included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Leveraging existing infrastructure: Brazil&rsquo;s Universal Health System (SUS) provided a robust framework for vaccine distribution.</li>
<li>Experience with mass vaccination: Annual flu shot campaigns honed the nation&rsquo;s logistical capabilities.</li>
<li>Cultural acceptance: High public trust in vaccines minimized hesitancy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/coronavirus-data-explorer.png" alt="coronavirus-data-explorer.png"></p>
<p>The result? By late 2021, Brazil had surpassed many wealthy nations in vaccination rates, demonstrating that even a country of continental proportions can execute complex public health initiatives effectively with the right systems and cultural factors in place.</p>
<h3 id="2-pix-revolutionizing-financial-inclusion">2. PIX: Revolutionizing Financial Inclusion</h3>
<p>In November 2020, Brazil&rsquo;s Central Bank launched PIX, an instant payment system that has since transformed the country&rsquo;s financial landscape. PIX allows instantaneous, 24/7 transfers between individuals and businesses, free of charge for personal use.</p>
<p>The impact has been profound:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial inclusion: Millions previously reliant on cash now participate in the digital economy.</li>
<li>Economic efficiency: Reduced transaction costs and increased velocity of money.</li>
<li>Innovation catalyst: Fintech startups have flourished, building on the PIX infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20230725094936/en/1849127/5/Pix_vs_credit_vs_debit_over_time.jpg" alt="https://mms.businesswire.com/media/20230725094936/en/1849127/5/Pix_vs_credit_vs_debit_over_time.jpg"></p>
<p>PIX&rsquo;s success lies in its universal adoption (mandated for all major financial institutions) and user-friendly design (you can transfer money just like you send a phone message). It demonstrates how good regulation and technology can work well, even (or especially) in development countries.</p>
<h3 id="3-the-real-plan-taming-hyperinflation">3. The Real Plan: Taming Hyperinflation</h3>
<p>While not recent, the Real Plan of 1994 remains one of Brazil&rsquo;s most significant economic achievements. It ended decades of hyperinflation, stabilizing the economy and laying the groundwork for future growth.</p>
<p>The plan&rsquo;s innovative approach included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction of a new currency (the Real) pegged to the US dollar</li>
<li>Strict monetary policies to control the money supply</li>
<li>Fiscal reforms to address budget deficits</li>
</ul>

<p>The Real Plan&rsquo;s success in bringing inflation from thousands of percent annually to single digits transformed Brazil&rsquo;s economic landscape, enabling long-term planning and investment that was previously impossible.</p>
<hr>
<p>These successes show what&rsquo;s possible when Brazil&rsquo;s state apparatus operates at its best. Imagine if this level of effectiveness could be consistently applied across all areas of the country&rsquo;s governance.</p>
