    <h1>Knowledge and Discipline</h1>

    

    <p>Imagine you want to reach a goal, such as being able to do 40 push-ups when you currently can only do 5.</p>
<p>I believe there are mainly three things you need to reach your goal: natural capacity (absence of serious physical limitations, etc.), knowledge, and discipline. You cannot change the first factor, so let&rsquo;s focus on the latter two.</p>
<p>Knowledge helps you figure out <strong>what</strong> you need to do. Imagine GPT-100 exists and is omniscient. You could ask it how to reach your goal as quickly as possible, and it might suggest the following (assuming for a moment, that this is indeed the fastest way to achieve your goal):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Workout Plan</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>work out 3x a week, performing 5 sets of push-ups doing as many reps as possible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Diet and Nutrition</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>consume more calories than you expend</li>
<li>Aim for at least 1.6 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Sleep and Recovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Supplements</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Take 3-5 grams of creatine daily</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Additional Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regularly check that your push-up form is correct</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Discipline then <strong>ensures that you do</strong> what you need to reach your goal</p>
<ul>
<li>don’t skip workouts</li>
<li>ensure you consume enough calories.</li>
<li>make sure you get adequate sleep every night.</li>
<li>don’t forget to take your supplements</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Concluding</p>
<p>If you don’t know what to do, you lack knowledge.</p>
<p>If you aren&rsquo;t doing what you know you should be, you lack discipline.</p>
