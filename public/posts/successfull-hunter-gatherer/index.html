    <h1>A Successful Hunter-Gatherer</h1>

    

    <p>I recently watched the documentary &ldquo;Hadza: Last of the First&rdquo; which explores one of the few remaining hunter-gatherer tribes. After watching it, I wondered what makes someone &ldquo;successful&rdquo; in that environment. Humanity has spent most of its existence like that, so maybe we can draw valuable insights from this.</p>
<p>A successful male in this environment is a combination of being a good:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hunter</strong> (provides for the community)</li>
<li><strong>Mentor</strong> (passes skills to younger generations)</li>
<li><strong>Mate</strong> (forms a long-term bond, raises a family)</li>
<li><strong>Leader</strong> (involves in community politics)</li>
</ul>
<p>To replicate that in modern society, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excel in a career and provide to your community<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Mentor the younger generation.</li>
<li>Raise a family.</li>
<li>Be a leader in your community.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is likely good advice for having a meaningful life.</p>
