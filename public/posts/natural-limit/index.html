    <h1>Natural Limit</h1>

    

    <p>In bodybuilding, there is the concept of the &ldquo;natural limit&rdquo;. It means the maximum potential you can achieve without the use of steroids.</p>
<p>There are some interesting points about this concept:</p>
<ul>
<li>Genetics matter and act as your limiting factor.</li>
<li>Despite this, there is still significant room for improvement.</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, thinking in these terms has helped a lot; it releases some of the anxiety that I have when doubting whether I will be able to reach a goal. I can ask myself, &ldquo;Am I doing everything I can to reach my goal?&rdquo; If the answer is yes, then I can allow my anxious self to relax.</p>
<p>And this mindset can be applied virtually anywhere.</p>
<p>Just ensure you are doing everything possible to achieve your goals.</p>

<li>This concept is very similar to the &lsquo;Dichotomy of Control of Stoicism&rsquo;, and the Input/Output metrics management style on Amazon.</li>
<li>One thing to note is that it is still possible to fail, even if you are doing everything you can. In this case, you should change your goal, or think really hard if you are <em>really</em> doing everything you can.</li>
