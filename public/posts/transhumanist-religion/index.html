    <h1>The Transhumanist Religion</h1>

    

    <p>From <a href="https://nickbostrom.com/views/transhumanist.pdf">Nick Bostrom&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Transhumanist FAQ&rdquo;</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While not a religion, transhumanism might serve a few of the same functions that people
have traditionally sought in religion. It offers a sense of direction and purpose and
suggests a vision that humans can achieve something greater than our present condition.
Unlike most religious believers, however, transhumanists seek to make their dreams
come true in this world, by relying not on supernatural powers or divine intervention but
on rational thinking and empiricism, through continued scientific, technological,
economic, and human development. Some of the prospects that used to be the exclusive
thunder of the religious institutions, such as very long lifespan, unfading bliss, and
godlike intelligence, are being discussed by transhumanists as hypothetical future
engineering achievements.</p>
