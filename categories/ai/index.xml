      <description>Since contextual bandits are relatively new, they haven&amp;rsquo;t been studied and tested so heavily as standard multi-armed bandits algorithms [1]. This being the case, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to design benchmarks for contextual bandits so these algorithms can be reliably tested, compared and improved.
Prerequisites  Contextual Bandits  Simplest benchmark As many people in the AI community advice, a toy example with low complexity provides better and faster debugging cycles, a good property of early-stage research and experimentation.</description>

      <description>In the contextual bandits problem, we have an environment with K possible actions. The environment returns some context x, taken from a distribution X. The environment also has a function f(x, k), that calculates the reward based on the context and the chosen action k.
The goal then is to find the policy $\pi$ that maximizes the rewards obtained in the long-term. A policy is a function that maps contexts to actions.</description>
